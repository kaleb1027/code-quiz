# code-quiz

## Description
In this coding quiz project you will be given 5 different multiple choice questions testing your HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge. The catch is that this is a timed quiz (75 seconds long), and for every question you get wrong, you are deducted 15 seconds from your allotted time. The goal is to answer all questions correctly and finish with as much time left as possible.
